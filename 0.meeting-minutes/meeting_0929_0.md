    -   GitHub projects will be used as a Kanban to track tasks and who they are assigned to, deadlines, and dependencies. This will be the source of truth to track the current status of a work task. A task will only be marked as completed when it has been code reviewed, merged, and validated within the main branch of version control.
    -   Tasks will be assigned based on subteam and then divided within subteam members based on availability and fairness.
    -   At a high level we will prioritize tasks that move the project in the direction of completing our MVP. At a low level, we will prioritize dependencies to ensure the team remains unblocked and we can continue working in parallel.
    -   A Discord server will be used to organize our internal group communication. Channels will be used to organize communication across subteams. Additionally, a resources channel will be used to pin important resources for quick access.
        Meeting minutes will be stored in the GitHub repo to keep track of the findings and key insights of each meeting.
-   Q9 - planning.md team
    -   Show up tutorial
    -   Set interval we checked messages 24-48 hours business on business days
    -   We will all be invited to a Microsoft Teams with our partner so that will be how we communicate in addition to the recurring meetings
    -   We will treat other with respect and respect one another’s time. If someone misses a meeting/deadline we will have a conversation with them.
-   Highlights - planning.md team
    -   Team processes, have a central hub for all things project related (Discord)
    -   Product
        -   Salesforce requirement
        -   UI/UX for the volunteering experience (they are happy with other parts)
        -   Happy with mobile-first web development (cross-platform, fits their audiences, quicker to dev, don’t need any mobile-specific APIs)
        -   One alternative was to improve the Salesforce applet, but the standalone allows us to have more control over UI/UX and future features

-   We will share emails with the client to be invited to the Microsoft Teams group
