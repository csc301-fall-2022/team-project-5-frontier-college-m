# Composables

This directory stores Vue composable functions that can be used inside of Vue functions. A common composable is a shared [pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) store.

See [Nuxt Docs](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/composables#composables-directory) for more info.

**Important** Functions exported from this directly are automatically imported in Vue files and don't need to be manually imported.
