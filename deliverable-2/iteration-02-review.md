# Team 5: Frontier College

## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Nov 04, 2022
 * Where: Online, over Discord

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

##### Github Projects
After each weekly meeting, we would all figure out what work is needed to be done divvy it up into small tasks that each person would be assigned to. On GitHub projects, we are able to keep track of everything we discussed in the meeting, as well as know which person is assigned to a task. In a group of 7 people, it's easy to lose track of which person is doing which task, so with the projects board we are able to communicate easily about each task as well as seek help from people who are dong similar tasks.


##### Ongoing Unit Testing
Every time somebody implements a feature, they create unit tests that ensure the program runs properly. This has been very useful as without unit testing, it becomes hard to track down where a program actually went wrong. The tests are documented properly, so if somebody wants to explore how someone else's code works, they can get a good understanding from the person who wrote the code, rather than someone who is assigned to write all unit tests.

##### Discord as a communication channel 
communication has been quick and easy via discord. We have been able to separate groups and ideas into channels which makes different parts of our project much more accessible.

##### Breaking into front-end and back-end groups 
Rather than working as one massive group, we split into two smaller groups, making communication more organized. We don't have one massive chat with both front-end and back-end details since some wouldn't be very relevant for the other end.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

> * 2 - 4 decisions.
> * Ordered from most to least important.
> * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
> * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

##### Not starting to code earlier
We were all very busy so obviously we didn't have much of a choice on this front but at the same time it definitely negatively impacted the project.

⚠️ TODO: add at least one more

#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

⚠️ TODO

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
- We prepared our demo by deploying our interim application to Heroku, and we also prepared our design mockups as reference
- We presented our mockups for TD2 to our partner over MS Teams, and showed the deployed frontend side-by-side. At that time backend integration was not available, so it was not part of the demo. 
- Our partner accepted our features and approved of our progress. We further confirmed our feature priority list and aligned our vision on what we can likely deliver by the end
- We learned that our understanding of the product is mostly aligned with the partner. There were a few tweaks that were requested here and there, and we plan to integrate that feedback in our future work.
