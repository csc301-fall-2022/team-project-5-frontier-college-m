# Team 5: Frontier College

## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

- When: Nov 04, 2022
- Where: Online, over Discord

## Process - Reflection

#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

##### Weekly meetings

We held weekly meetings during tutorials. They provide a recurring time when all members can relay their progress and discuss the next steps for the project. These weekly meetings turned out to be successful as, after each session, every member had a general idea of what to do in the upcoming week, increasing team coordination and efficiency. More specific task assignments were done within subteams.

##### Subteams

For TD2, our group was divided into subteams responsible for the backend and the frontend. Within each subteam, we held meetings on Discord to hash out the overall design as well as split the work into tasks that are assigned to individual subteam members. These assignments are put onto our GitHub Projects board. Smaller subteams made it easier to schedule synchronous meetings, as well as facilitate asynchronous communication since the insights or questions a member has may primarily be relevant to individuals working on the same part of the project. In particular, this was useful when discussing issues during implementation and their solutions.

##### Github Projects

After each weekly meeting, we would all figure out what work is needed to be done divvy it up into small tasks that each person would be assigned to. On GitHub projects, we are able to keep track of everything we discussed in the meeting, as well as know which person is assigned to a task. In a group of 7 people, it's easy to lose track of which person is doing which task, so with the projects board we are able to communicate easily about each task as well as seek help from people who are dong similar tasks.

##### Ongoing Unit Testing

Every time somebody implements a feature, they create unit tests that ensure the program runs properly. This has been very useful as without unit testing, it becomes hard to track down where a program actually went wrong. The tests are documented properly, so if somebody wants to explore how someone else's code works, they can get a good understanding from the person who wrote the code, rather than someone who is assigned to write all unit tests.

##### Discord as a communication channel

communication has been quick and easy via discord. We have been able to separate groups and ideas into channels which makes different parts of our project much more accessible.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

##### Partner meeting schedule

During TD1, we decided on having partner meetings approximately once every two weeks. This turned out to be unsuccessful. At the beginning of TD2, we were planning on implementing a database with PostgreSQL and using Prisma as the ORM. Work had already started on the database when we met with our partner. They intended for data to be mainly located on their preexisting salesforce system so we had to pivot and scrap the work we did on the database.

##### Communication

Despite process decisions such as weekly meetings and subteams, our team still had some communication issues. One example is how the various backend API endpoints were developed. Endpoints were split between multiple group members. When each member made their endpoints, finer implementation details were not effectively communicated, resulting in inconsistent design and formatting.

##### Not starting to code earlier

We were all very busy so obviously we didn't have much of a choice on this front but at the same time it definitely negatively impacted the project.

#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

- Ordered from most to least important.
- Explain why you are making a change.

⚠️ TODO

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

- We prepared our demo by deploying our interim application to Heroku, and we also prepared our design mockups as reference
- We presented our mockups for TD2 to our partner over MS Teams, and showed the deployed frontend side-by-side. At that time backend integration was not available, so it was not part of the demo.
- Our partner accepted our features and approved of our progress. We further confirmed our feature priority list and aligned our vision on what we can likely deliver by the end
- We learned that our understanding of the product is mostly aligned with the partner. There were a few tweaks that were requested here and there, and we plan to integrate that feedback in our future work.
