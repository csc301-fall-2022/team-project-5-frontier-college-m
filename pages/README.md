# Pages

This folder stores pages. Every Vue file created in this directory creates a URL that displays the contents of the file.

See [Nuxt Documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/pages) for more details.

**Important** Vue Page Components must have a single root HTML element for page transitions.
